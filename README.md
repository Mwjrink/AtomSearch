# AtomSearch
Spotlight search equivalent for windows

## Inspiration
Are you a windows user who has ever wished that the start menu search wasn't shit? Ever used a Mac? Their spotlight search is actually pretty awesome.

## What am I trying to do?
I am attempting to bring that experience to windows, with some added functionality

## Plugins
I will never be able to know what everyone wants out of this so I offer you the ability to make it how you want. The aim is to fully support plugins and add ins as naturally and as intuitively as possible

Currenlty the chrome search is written entirely in json as well as the cmd line search, it is completely dynamic and can be modified to your hearts content.

Want to be able to perform some other function? Make a json file put it in the *Commands* folder and it will be loaded and available to you.

Want something much more complicated with custom result sets? Create an executable/command line tool and link directly to it through a json file.

If you do decide to expand the functionality let me know and I can add a link directly to it so other users can find and download it or even host it here if you'd like. 

### Future plans
I plan to, in future, add a list of all the plugins available and allow users to download them from directly within the app.
